**AutoAuditAI: GenAI for Financial Audits**

**Overview:**
AutoAuditAI is a Generative AI-powered auditing assistant designed to revolutionize financial audits. The project simulates an AI auditor capable of analyzing transactional data, detecting anomalies, and generating insightful audit reports. It integrates advanced AI techniques to enhance accuracy, efficiency, and explainability in financial auditing processes.

**Key Features:**

- **Prompt Engineering (Day 1):** Crafted effective prompts to guide the AI in understanding and analyzing financial data.

- **Embeddings + Similarity Search (Day 2):** Implemented embeddings to represent transactional data semantically, enabling similarity searches to identify related transactions and patterns.

- **Function Calling + LangGraph Logic (Day 3):** Utilized function calling mechanisms and LangGraph to structure the audit logic, allowing dynamic interactions and decision-making processes.

- **Real-world Risk Visualizations (Day 4):** Developed visualizations to represent risk assessments and audit findings, facilitating intuitive understanding of complex data.

- **MLOps Mindset + AgentOps Audit Flow (Day 5):** Adopted MLOps practices for model deployment and monitoring, and designed AgentOps flows to automate audit tasks effectively.

**Synthetic Data Integration:**
The project incorporates synthetic datasets enriched with:

- **Fraud Flags:** Indicators of potentially fraudulent transactions.

- **Escalation Tags:** Markers for transactions requiring further investigation.

- **Audit Notes:** Annotations providing context and explanations for audit decisions.

**Technologies Used:**
Python, LangChain, OpenAI API, FAISS, Streamlit, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Weaviate/ChromaDB, Docker, MLflow.
